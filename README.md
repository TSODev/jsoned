**`jless`, but you can actually edit things.**

Keyboard-driven TUI for viewing and editing JSON files — with full structural editing, undo/redo, search, and format conversion between JSON, YAML, TOML, CSV, and JSONL.

## Why not jless / fx / jq / difftastic?

| Tool | View | Edit | Convert | Diff | Pipe mode |
|------|------|------|---------|------|-----------|
| **jsoned** | ✓ | ✓ full | ✓ | ✓ structural | ✓ |
| jless | ✓ | ✗ read-only | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| fx | ✓ | ✗ filter only | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| jq | ✗ no TUI | ✗ | partial | ✗ | ✓ |
| difftastic / delta | ✗ no TUI | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ line-based | ✓ |

jsoned's diff is **structural** (compares by key path, not by line) — it's not trying to replace
difftastic/delta for general text diffing, but it understands JSON/YAML/TOML/CSV shape directly,
so reordered keys or reformatted whitespace don't show up as noise, and it can even diff across
two different formats (`a.json --diff b.yaml`).

## Features

- **3-panel layout** — Source (annotated JSON), Explorer (key/type/value table), Detail (node preview)
- **Edit** scalar values inline with type conversion (String ↔ Number ↔ Boolean ↔ Null)
- **Rename** keys, **add** / **delete** / **duplicate** / **move** nodes
- **Wrap** any node in an Array or Object with a single keypress
- **Undo / redo** — 50-level history, captured before every change
- **Copy / paste** nodes within the document
- **Sort** Object children alphabetically; **expand** or **collapse** entire subtrees
- **Search** — `/` to search keys and values, `n`/`N` to navigate matches
- **Structural lint** — automatic checks on load and after every edit (empty keys, excessive depth); warnings highlighted in orange; `Tab`/`Shift+Tab` to navigate; correcting a node clears its warning instantly
- **Plugins** — `|` opens a Plugins menu to transform the selected node; ships with a `jq` plugin (bundled, no external `jq` binary needed)
- **Diff** — `jsoned a.json --diff b.json` opens a read-only, structural (key-path) diff between two files, even across formats (JSON vs YAML vs TOML vs CSV); headless with `--to text|json`
- **Save as** any supported format with `W` — format picker + filename editor in-TUI
- **Pipe mode** — `cat file.json | jsoned` reads stdin; `s` writes JSON to stdout and exits
- **Headless conversion** — `jsoned file.yaml --to json` with no TUI
- Dot-path indicator (`steps.0.extracted`) always shows where you are in the tree
- Fast on large files — flat render model, no DOM reflow

See [USAGE.md](USAGE.md) for the full reference, [What's New](CHANGELOG.md) for the release
history, and [BENCHMARK.md](BENCHMARK.md) for reproducible performance numbers on large files.

## Installation

```sh
cargo install jsoned
```

Requires Rust 1.75+.

---

## Usage

```sh
jsoned file.json          # open in TUI
jsoned file.yaml          # auto-detect format, open in TUI
jsoned                    # start with an empty JSON object

# Stdin / stdout pipe mode
cat file.json | jsoned              # read from stdin, TUI on stderr
cat file.json | jsoned > out.json   # edit then s to write to stdout and exit
TERAPI_JSON_EDITOR=jsoned terapi …  # drop-in external editor integration

# Headless conversion — no TUI
jsoned file.yaml --to json
jsoned file.json --to yaml --output converted.yaml
jsoned data.csv  --to json

# Diff — structural, key-path comparison between two files (any supported formats)
jsoned a.json --diff b.json                    # read-only diff TUI
jsoned a.json --diff b.json --to text          # headless, +/-/~ report to stdout
jsoned a.json --diff b.json --to json | jq .   # headless, machine-readable report

# JSONL — one JSON value per line, opens as an array (each line = one element)
jsoned data.jsonl              # edit like any array
jsoned data.jsonl --to json    # convert to a single JSON array
jsoned data.json --to jsonl    # array → one line per element; non-array root → single line
```

Supported formats: `json`, `yaml`, `toml`, `csv`, `jsonl`

| `j` / `k` or `↓` / `↑` | Navigate |
| `]` / `n` | Jump to next change |

## Format notes

| Format | Read | Write | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|-------|
| JSON | ✓ | ✓ | Key order preserved |
| YAML | ✓ | ✓ | |
| TOML | ✓ | ✓ | `null` values not supported by TOML |
| CSV | ✓ | ✓ | Export: dot-notation flatten + 1-level explosion; root can be object or array |
| JSONL | ✓ | ✓ | One JSON value per line ↔ a single JSON array; a non-array root exports as one line |
